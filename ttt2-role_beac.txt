The beacon is an innocent who becomes more powerful each time someone on their team is confirmed dead. How they are buffed is determined by a series of convars, but by default consists of minor improvements to a slew of stats, including: jump power, speed, damage resistance, damage, fire rate, and health regeneration.
 
If they accrue enough power, they literally light up and their role is revealed to everyone. This makes them as trustworthy as a detective, but will also alert antagonists to their growing power.
 
There is but one catch: The beacon mustn't kill someone on their team. If they do, they will become an innocent, and take (potentially lethal) damage. Furthermore, an innocent killer can never become a beacon (ex. an amnesiac who kills the beacon in an attempt to inherit their powers). Such a person becomes an innocent instead.
 
A final note: The default settings are on the weaker end of the balance spectrum, and exist mostly to show what it can do. Feel free to use the many convars to rebalance the beacon to best fit your server.

Convars are variables that are introduced to allow server owners to customize the gameplay without changing the code. There are always a handful of convars automatically created by TTT2, that define the spawn parameters of this role and are found in ULX. Additionally there might be some role specific convars, which have to be set in the server config file.
